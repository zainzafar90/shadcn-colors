**Change Colors for HSL values**

- Select the `hsl` value e.g. `120 40% 70%` within your `.css` file
- Type `cmd + shift + p` or `ctrl + shift + p`
- Type `shadcn/colors: Change HSL Color` and type the `hex` value there
- That's it you should see your latest `hsl` converted from `hex` you provided

## Note

- If the color picker isnâ€™t showing, double-check your HSL syntax
- Large files with lots of colors might slow things down a bit

Happy Coding!
